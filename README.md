COVID-19 Time Series Chart
==========================

<a href="https://davidbau.github.io/covid-19-chart">See the chart at
https://davidbau.github.io/covid-19-chart</a>.

My physician wife wanted to see some summaries of U.S. covid-19
stats that are not graphed in the press, so I wrote this short HTML
page to create those rollups.

This page is (currently) less than 200 lines of HTML+JS, using chartist.js
(with legend and logaxis extensions), vue.js, lodash.js, and papaparse.
It should be easy to generalize to international data or other stats,
and pull requests are welcome.

Code is at <a href="https://github.com/davidbau/covid-19-chart">
