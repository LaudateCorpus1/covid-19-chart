COVID-19 Time Series Chart
==========================

My physician wife wanted to see some summaries of U.S. stats that are
not graphed in the press, so I wrote this short HTML page to create
those rollups.

The page pulls data from the Johns Hopkins CSSE feed on github,
and could be easily modified to examine interntional data or other
statistics.

Uses chartist.js with chartist-legend chartist-logaxis extensions;
and vue, lodash and papaparse.
